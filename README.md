This is a MATLAB implementation for facial recognition using a machine learning technique called Principal Component Analysis on the ORL Dataset - https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/orl

This was my First Machine Learning project that I worked on during the summer of 2017 as part of a summer research internship in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at NIT Rourkela under the guidance of Professor Anup Nandy. The objective was to familiarize myself with programming on MATLAB and understand the math behind principal component analysis.
