This is a MATLAB implementation for facial recognition using a machine learning technique called Principal Component Analysis on the Database of Faces (Formerly ORL Dataset) - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kasikrit/att-database-of-faces

This was my First Machine Learning project that I worked on during the summer of 2017 as part of a summer research internship in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at NIT Rourkela under the guidance of Professor Anup Nandy.
